The goal of this project is to develop an online e-commerce platform that 
enables users to browse, select, and purchase products online. The platform 
will have two main user roles: the customer and the admin. Customers will 
be able to browse through the product catalog, add items to their cart, make 
purchases, and view order history. Admins will be responsible for managing 
the inventory, processing orders, and viewing sales analytics.
